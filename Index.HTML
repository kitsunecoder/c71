                I visited puerto rico last month, and it was such an awesome experience! 
                </h5>
                <p class="text-left text-muted"> According to Wikitravel, "Puerto Rico is a Caribbean island that is a self-governing commonwealth of the United States of America. Located in the Caribbean Sea to the east of the Dominican Republic and west of the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico lies on a key shipping lane to the Panama Canal, the Mona Passage."  I say that this beautiful island is worth a visit, and that's all you need to know!
                <br>
                    Last month, I was super excited when spring break began.  School had been boring (as usual), and I had a trip to look forward to!  I had known we were going to Puerto Rico for some time, and now it was finally happening!  I will give a short summary of each day, and I hope you enjoy!
                    <br><br>
                    Day 1: The airport was packed!  I was scared of getting lost in the crowd, but we got to the plane in one piece.  I was taking picture of the islands that we passed over in the airplane, and I was editing them when the plane landed.  We arrived at our hotel 30 minutes later, and I can summarize it in one word: BINOCULARS. They had binoculars! THey were soooooooooooo cool! I could see a person's face from 10 miles away!  That night we ate a one of my dad's favorite Puerto-Rican restaurants, and I had shrimp in garlic sauce.  It was so good! 5 stars!
                    <br><br>
                    Day 2: We woke up and ate at Dennys, then got in our rental car for a 2 hour drive to Castillo San Felipe de Morro, a fort in San Juan.

                    Sam Gribley is a 12-year-old boy who intensely dislikes living in his parents' cramped New York City apartment with his eight brothers and sisters. He decides to run away to his great-grandfather's abandoned farm in the Catskill Mountains to live in the wilderness. The novel begins in the middle of Sam's story, with Sam huddled in his treehouse home in the forest during a severe blizzard. Frightful, Sam's pet peregrine falcon, and The Baron, a weasel, share the home with him. In a flashback, Sam reminisces about how he came to be there.
